layout: frontpage

#
# Use the call for action to show a button on the frontpage
#
# To make internal links, just use a permalink like this
# url: /getting-started/
#
# To style the button in different colors, use no value
# to use the main color or success, alert or secondary.
# To change colors see sass/_01_settings_colors.scss

## Research Overview
The Intelligent Imaging & Computational Vision (IICV) Laboratory investigates artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) for imaging science and vision science. 

Our current projects include:
1. Deep generative model-produced virtual population for conducting virtual imaging trials.
2. Machine learning-based numerical observers for calculating task-based measures of image quality.
3. Visual search and biologically plausible computer vision.
4. Deep learning for task-driven computational imaging.

Research in the IICV Lab is conducted within the Global Institute of Future Technology (GIFT) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). Students in the IICV Lab come from various institutes including GIFT and UM-SJTU JI. The IICV Lab is directed by Prof. Weimin Zhou.
